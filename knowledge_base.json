      "question": "What is the difference between the backspace and delete keys?",
      "answer": "The Backspace key is typically labeled with an arrow that points to the left and may also have the word \"Backspace\" on it. The Backspace key is used to delete the character to the left of the cursor or insertion point. When you press the Backspace key, it erases the character before the cursor and moves the cursor one position to the left. The Delete key is typically labeled with the word \"Delete\" or \"Del\" and may have an arrow that points to the right. The Delete key is used to delete the character to the right of the cursor or insertion point. When you press the Delete key, it erases the character after the cursor but does not move the cursor position."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is there a difference between Return and Enter?",
      "answer": "The \"Return\" key is primarily associated with older typewriters and early computer keyboards. On typewriters, pressing the \"Return\" key would physically return the carriage to the beginning of the next line. In computing, the \"Return\" key typically functions as a carriage return or line feed, moving the cursor to the beginning of the next line in a document or text field. The \"Enter\" key is commonly found on modern computer keyboards and is used to execute a command or confirm an action. In most cases, pressing the \"Enter\" key indicates that the user has finished entering data or commands and wants to proceed. The \"Enter\" key is often used to submit forms, confirm selections, or execute commands in various applications and interfaces. While the functionality of the \"Return\" and \"Enter\" keys may vary slightly depending on the software or platform, in many contexts, they are essentially the same key and perform similar functions, such as moving to a new line or confirming an action. The key might be labeled differently based on the keyboard layout and manufacturer, but their primary functions are the same thing. How do you like to say it, \"Enter\" or \"Return?\""
    },
    {
      "question": "I like \"Return.\"",

      "answer": "A clicky pen or a cap pen?"
    },
    {
      "question": "A clicky pen.",
      "answer": "When you click the button or press the top of the pen to extend the pen tip, a small locking mechanism engages to keep the pen tip in place. This locking mechanism typically consists of small grooves or notches on the rod that extends the pen tip and corresponding ridges or tabs inside the pen body. When the pen tip is fully extended, the grooves on the rod align with the ridges inside the pen body, creating a secure connection that holds the pen tip in place. To retract the pen tip, you click the button or press the top again, which disengages the locking mechanism and allows the pen tip to be pulled back into the pen body."

    },
    {
      "question": "Give 10 reasons why Apple Macbooks are bad.",
      "answer": "Macbooks are generally more expensive than other laptops with similar specifications. Macbooks have limited options for hardware customization compared to Windows laptops. Macbooks may be thin,. Macbooks have no regular USB ports, and only USB-C ports, which can be inconvenient for users who need to connect multiple devices. The availability of certain specialized or industry-specific software may be limited on macOS compared to Windows, potentially impacting certain user needs or preferences. Repairs or upgrades for Macbooks can be expensive, especially if the device is out of warranty. Some users may feel limited by the need to use other Apple products or services to fully utilize a Macbook. A Macbook uses an Apple Sillicon (ARM64) processor, which means that they are slower than popular processor architectures, such as x86, x64 or AMD64. Users who are more familiar with Windows may find it challenging to adjust to macOS initially."
